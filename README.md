# flexbox

 Flexbox is a CSS layout module that makes it easier to create flexible and responsive layouts for web pages.
 
 With Flexbox, you can control the size, position, and alignment of elements within a container, regardless of the screen size or device orientation.
 
 Setting the display property of the parent container to "flex" will activate flexbox layout for the container and its children.
